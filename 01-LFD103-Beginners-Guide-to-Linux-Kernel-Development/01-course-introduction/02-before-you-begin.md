### Course Support
> - One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Class Forum.

> - Class Forum: https://forum.linuxfoundation.org/categories/lfd103-class-forum

> - The forum can be used in the following ways.

```plaintext
- To introduce yourself to other peers taking this course.

- To discuss concepts, tools and technologies presented in this course, or related
  to the topics discussed in the course materials.

- To ask questions or report issues with labs or course content.

- To share resources and ideas related to Linux Kernel development.
```

> - The class forum will be reviewed periodically by the Linux Foundation staff,
    but it is primarily a community resource, not an `ask the instructor` service.

### Course Timing
> - This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going
    through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace,
    and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you
    come back to start a new session.

> - However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work,
    as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

> - You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you
    registered, even after you have completed the course.

> - The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It
    is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only
    skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed
    you have not been exposed to yet.

> - But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread
    your own path through the material.

<br />
<br />



### Assessments
> - While not having lab exercises per se, this course is hands-on, and guides
    you through the processes involved in Linux Kernel development.

> - At the end of each chapter, you will also find a series of knowledge check
    questions. These questions, just like the labs, were designed with one main
    goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce
    what you have learned. We would also like to emphasize that you will not be
    required to take a final exam to complete this course.
