### The Linux Foundation
> - `The Linux Foundation` provdes a neutral, trusted hub for developers to
    code, manage, and scale open technology projects.

> - Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,000
    members and is the world's leading home for collaboration on open
    source software, open standards, open data and open hardware.

> - The Linux Foundation's methodology focuses on leveraging best practices
    focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of
    contributors, users and solution providers to create sustainable models
    for open collaboration.

> - The Linux Foundation hosts Linux, the world's largest and most pervasive
    open source software project in history. It is also home to Linux creator
    Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman.

> - The success of Linux has catalyzed growth in the open source community,
    demonstrating the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring
    countless new projects across all industries and levels of the technology
    stack.

> - As a result, the Linux Foundation today hosts far more than Linux; it is
    the umbrella for many critical open source projects that power corporations
    today, spanning virtually all industry sectors.

> - Some of the technologies we focus on include big data and analytics,
    networking, embedded systems and IoT, web tools, cloud computing, edge
    computing, automotive, security, blockchain, and many more.

### The Linux Foundation Events
> - Over 85,000 open source technologists and leaders worldwide gather at Linux
    Foundation events annually to share ideas, learn and collaborate.

> - Linux Foundation events are the meeting place of choice for open source
    maintainers, developers, architects, infrastructure managers, and sysadmins
    and technologists leading open source program offices, and other critical
    leadership functions.

> - These events are the best place to gain visibility within the open source
    community quickly and advance open source development work by forming
    connections with the people evaluating and creating the next generation of
    technology.

> - They provide a forum to share and gain knowledge, help organizations identify
    software trends early to inform future technology investments, connect
    employers withh talent, and showcase technologies and services to influential
    open source professionals, media, and analysts around the globe.

> - The Linux Foundation hosts an increasing number of events each year.

https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification-catalog/
```

> - We've taken a new innovative approach to open source certification that allows
    you to showcase your skills in a way that other peers will respect and employers
    will trust:

```plaintext
- You can take your certification exam from any computer, anywhere, at any time.
- The certification exams are either performance-based or multiple choice.
- The exams are distribution flexible.
- The exams are up-to-date, testing knowledge and skills that actually matter in today's
  IT environment.
```

<br />
<br />



### Training Certification Firewall
> - The Linux Foundation has two separate training divisions: Course Delivery and Certification.
    These two divisions are separated by a `firewall`.

> - The curriculum development and maintenance division of the Linux Foundation Training
    department has no direct role in developing, administering, or grading certification exams.

> - Enforcing this self-imposed firewall ensures that independent organizations and companies
    can develop third party training material, geared towards helpingg test takers pass their
    certification exams.

> - Furthermore, it ensures thaht there are no secret `tips` (or secrets in general) that one
    needs to be familiar with in order to succeed.

> - It also permits the Linux Foundation to develop a very robust set of courses that do far more
    than `teach the test`, but rather equip attendees with a broad knowledge of the many areas
    they may be required to master to have a successful career in open source system administration.
