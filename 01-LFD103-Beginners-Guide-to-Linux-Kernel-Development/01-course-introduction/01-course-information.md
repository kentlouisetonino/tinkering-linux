### Welcome to LFD103!
> - The `Linux Kernel` is the largest component of the Linux ecosystem,
    and is charged with managing the hardware, running user programs, and
    maintaining the security and integrity of the whole system.

> - It is a 24 hour a day, seven days a week, 365 day a year development
    process that results in a new release once every 9-10 weeks, along
    with several stable and extended stable releases.

> - At all times, new development and current release integration cycles
    run in parallel.

> - `LFD103` is designed for anyone interested in becoming a Linux Kernel
    Developer and contributor. The course aims to ease the Linux Kernel
    Mentorhship application process. It also serves as a resource for
    developers from companies and communities that might not be able to
    take advantage of the mentorship program, and want to learn kernel
    development on their own; as well as a resource for experienced
    engineers new to open source and upstream kernel development that are
    tasked with working with the kernel community.
