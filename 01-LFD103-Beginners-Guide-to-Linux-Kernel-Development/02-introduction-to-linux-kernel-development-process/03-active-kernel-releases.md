## Active Releases
```plaintext
Release Candidate (RC)
    - Release Candidate or RC releases are mainline kernel pre-releases that are used
      for testing new features in the mainline.
    - These releases must be compiled from source.
    - Kernel developers test these releases for bugs and regressions.

Stable
    - Stable releases are bug fix-only releases.
    - After Linus releases a mainline kernel, it moves into stable mode.
    - Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the mainline kernel and
      applied to stable git by a designated stable kernel release maintainer.
    - Stable kernel updates are released on average, once a week, or on an as needed
      basis.

Long-term
    - Long-term releases are stable releases selected for long-term maintenance to
      provide critical bug fixes for older kernel trees.
