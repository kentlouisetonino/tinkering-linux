## $\textnormal{Welcome to LFD103}$

> - The `Linux Kernel` is the largest component of the Linux ecosystem, <br />
    and is charged with managing the hardware, running user programs, and <br />
    maintaining the security and integrity of the whole system. <br />

> - It is a 24 hour a day, seven days a week, 365 day a year development <br />
    process that results in a new release once every 9-10 weeks, along <br />
    with several stable and extended stable releases. <br />

> - At all times, new development and current release integration cycles <br />
    run in parallel.

> - `LFD103` is designed for anyone interested in becoming a Linux Kernel <br />
    Developer and contributor.

> - The course aims to ease the Linux Kernel Mentorhship application process. <br />

> - It also serves as a resource for developers from companies and communities <br />
    that might not be able to take advantage of the mentorship program, and <br />
    want to learn kernel development on their own; as well as a resource for <br />
    experienced engineers new to open source and upstream kernel development that <br />
    are tasked with working with the kernel community.
