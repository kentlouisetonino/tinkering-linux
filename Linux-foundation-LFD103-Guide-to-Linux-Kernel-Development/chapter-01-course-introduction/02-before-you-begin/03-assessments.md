## $\textnormal{Assessments}$

> - While not having lab exercises per se, this course is hands-on, and guides
    you through the processes involved in Linux Kernel development.

> - At the end of each chapter, you will also find a series of knowledge check
    questions. These questions, just like the labs, were designed with one main
    goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce
    what you have learned. We would also like to emphasize that you will not be
    required to take a final exam to complete this course.
