## $\textnormal{Course Timing}$

> - This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going
    through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace,
    and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you
    come back to start a new session.

> - However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work,
    as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

> - You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you
    registered, even after you have completed the course.

> - The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It
    is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only
    skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed
    you have not been exposed to yet.

> - But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread
    your own path through the material.
