## $\textnormal{Linux Foundation}$

> - `The Linux Foundation` provides a neutral, trusted hub for developers to
    code, manage, and scale open technology projects.

> - Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,000
    members and is the world's leading home for collaboration on open
    source software, open standards, open data and open hardware.

> - The Linux Foundation's methodology  focuses on leveraging best practices
    and addressing the needs of contributors, users and solution providers to
    create sustainable models for open collaboration.

> - The Linux Foundation hosts Linux, the world's largest and most pervasive
    open source software project in history. It is also home to Linux creator
    Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman.

> - The success of Linux has catalyzed growth in the open source community,
    demonstrating the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring
    countless new projects across all industries and levels of the technology
    stack.

> - As a result, the Linux Foundation today hosts far more than Linux; it is
    the umbrella for many critical open source projects that power corporations
    today, spanning virtually all industry sectors.

> - Some of the technologies we focus on include big data and analytics,
    networking, embedded systems and IoT, web tools, cloud computing, edge
    computing, automotive, security, blockchain, and many more.
